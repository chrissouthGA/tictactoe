### Tic Tac Toe Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Game Rules
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
Player 1 uses hearts (❤️) and Player 2 uses circles (⭕).
The first player to get 3 of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
If the entire board is filled with symbols and no player has won, the game is a draw.
Getting Started
To play the game, simply open the index.html file in your web browser.

## Game Controls
Click on an empty cell to place your symbol on the board.
To start a new game, click the "Restart" button.
## Score Keeping
This game does have built-in score keeping until page refresh.

## Technical Details
This game is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game logic is handled by the JavaScript code in script.js, while the HTML and CSS files provide the structure and styling for the game board and user interface.

The game uses a simple algorithm to check for a win or draw condition on the board, and updates the user interface to reflect the result of the game.
